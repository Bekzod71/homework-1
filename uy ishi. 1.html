<p></html>TOLEON WEHT</h5></p>
<p>I ask the indulgencc of children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. 
 I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up underesands everything, even books about children. 
 I have a third reason: he lives in Franke where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheerng up. If all these 
 reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. 
 All grown-ups once children-although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>
 <p></html>TOLEON WEHT WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</h5></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center">I</h1>
<p>once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called <i> True Stories from Nature,
 </i>about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of a boa constriction in the
act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</p>

<p> In the book it said: <i>"Boa constriktors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep thraugh the six months that they need for digistion."</i></p>
<p> I ponderd delipy, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My drawing Number One. It looked something like this: </p>
<img src="istockphoto-1355035705-1024x1024.jpg" alt="2022" width="300">
<p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightend thm.</p>
<p>But thy answered:<i> "Frighten? Why should any one be frightend by a hat?"</i></p>
<p>My drawing was not a picture of  a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown not able to underesand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-up could see it cleary. They always need to have thngs explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this: </p>
<img src="istockphoto-1300927170-170667a.jpg" alt="bu yerda chiroyli manzarani rasmi bor" width="300" height="200">
<p>The grown-ups' responose, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constriktors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithimetik, and gramar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificcent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of
    my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never  underesand anything by themselves and it is tiresome for children to be alwys and forevar explaining things to them</p>
<p>So then I chose another profissional, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and  it is true that geography has ben very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.</p>
<p>In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been cocerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimatly, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.</p>
<p>Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clcar-sighted, tried the expriment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try tofind out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, wauld always say:</p>
<p><i>"That is a hat."</i></p>
<p>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center">II</h1>
<p>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I coluld really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert 
    of sahara, six yeas ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I set myselft to atmpt the dificult repaist all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.</p>
<p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an add little voise. It said:                   </p>
<p><i> "If you please-draw me a shep!"</i></p>
<p><i>"What!"</i></p>
<p><i>Draw me a sheep</i></p>
<p>I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruk. I bilinked my eyes hard. I looked carefuly all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best potrait that, later, I was able to make of him.                    </p>
